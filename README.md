# EarthMC Ice Highways Map

This is a tool that aims to give information on stations and lines across the EarthMC server. However, right now, it only has 87 lines and 580 stations (including junctions and interchanges and elevators). You can contribute station and line information by posting an issue with the tag 'newlocation.'
